Employee-Database-App

Perform CRUD.

The Employee Database App is a Java-based application designed to perform basic database operations using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It connects to a MySQL database hosted locally through XAMPP, allowing users to manage employee records efficiently. This includes the ability to add new employees, view all records, update existing details, and delete entries from the database. The database schema is created using phpMyAdmin, and all operations are executed securely using PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection and ensure reliable interaction with the database.

This project serves as a foundational exercise in integrating Java with relational databases, demonstrating real-world CRUD operations in a console-based environment. It reinforces essential concepts like database connectivity, SQL execution through Java, and the use of JDBC classes such as Connection, PreparedStatement, Statement, and ResultSet. Ideal for beginners, the application lays the groundwork for building more advanced data-driven Java applications in the future, with potential extensions like GUI integration or cloud databaseÂ support.
